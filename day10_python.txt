Q) What is while loop? When do we use it ?
A) The while loop is a fundamental control flow structure in programming, enabling the execution of a block of code repeatedly as long as the specified condition  remains true.


Q) What is a function. Why do we use functions ?
A) A function is a set of statements that when called perform some specific task.
   When we want to use the same lines of code again and again, we use functions.
   Functions are used to ignore repetative works.


Q) How to specify FUNCTION keyword ?
A) Syntax : 
            def function_name(argument1, argument2,...):
		lines of code


Q) How to read multiple variables in a single line?
A) Ex:
      a,b = map(int,input("Enter numbers").split(" "))
      print(a,b)

      o/p :  Enter numbers 10 20
             10 20

  Ex: 
      a,b = map(int,input("Enter numbers").split(","))
      print(a,b)

      o/p : Enter numbers 10,20
            10 20


-----------------------
Q) Which parameters we have to give to map() method ?
A) We have to pass 2 parameters.
   Considering the above examples, we have given 'int' because, we want a and b to be in int datatype.
   input() method is used to display the data to the user to enter input.
   For splitting the entered values, we use .split() method.

Position of arguments in a function:-

Ex: def greet(name, location)
	print(f"hello {name}")
	print(f"are you from this {location}?")
    greet("sai","AP")

   o/p :  hello sai
          are you from this AP?



Ex: def greet(name, location)
	print(f"hello {name}")
	print(f"are you from this {location}?")
    greet("AP", "sai")

    o/p:  hello AP
          are you from this sai?


--------------------------------

Keyword arguments:-

Ex: def greet(name, location)
	print(f"hello {name}")
	print(f"are you from this {location}?")
    greet(location = "AP", name = "sai")

   o/p : hello sai
         are you from this AP?
